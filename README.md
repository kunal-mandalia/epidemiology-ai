The demo illustrates a typhoon-driven epidemiological event sequence in SE Asia, showing how different data sources signal the unfolding situation:

1. Typhoon landfall – weather news reports heavy rain and winds (Zambales).

2. Flooding – local streets submerged; social media posts report waterlogged areas.

3. Vector proliferation – stagnant water increases mosquito activity (news reports, social media).

4. Early health signals – residents report gastrointestinal symptoms on Twitter.

5. Hospital admissions – clinical records show patients admitted with GI symptoms.

6. Mortality – severe cases and deaths captured in hospital records.

7. Policy response – mosquito control measures and flood safety guidelines issued.

This sequence demonstrates cause-and-effect over time, emphasizing how different signals feed into AI-informed epidemiology.
